# Structura-Overview

# Welcome to Structura

**Structura | Exploring Code Architecture** is a collaborative space for exploring and implementing various software architecture patterns. Our mission is to provide practical examples, guides, and projects that dive deep into architectural concepts, from N-Tier and Layered architectures to Microservices and beyond.

## What You'll Find Here

- **N-Tier Architecture**: Explore the basics and implementation of N-Tier applications.
- **Layered Architecture**: Understand the separation of concerns and how to structure layered applications.
- **Monoliths and Modular Monoliths**: Learn about traditional and modular approaches to monolithic applications.
- **Microservices**: Discover the principles of microservices architecture and how to build scalable systems.
- **Clean Architecture & DDD**: Delve into clean coding practices and domain-driven design.
